                            I’m Saptarshi Upadhyay, a full-stack software developer with hands-on experience building scalable web applications and intelligent systems. My work spans modern frontend development with React and TypeScript, robust backend systems using Node.js and Express, and cloud-ready deployments leveraging tools like Docker, AWS, and Vercel. I focus on writing clean, maintainable code and designing systems that are both performant and easy to evolve.

                            Alongside full-stack development, I have a strong interest in machine learning and data-driven problem solving. I’ve worked with applied ML concepts and enjoy bridging traditional software engineering with intelligent decision-making systems. Whether it’s designing APIs, building user-centric interfaces, or experimenting with AI-driven solutions, I’m motivated by curiosity, continuous learning, and delivering practical, well-engineered solutions.

                            My aim is to grow as a software engineer by building scalable, impactful applications that combine strong engineering principles with intelligent systems. I strive to deepen my expertise in full-stack development while continuously exploring machine learning and AI to solve real-world problems. By working in challenging environments and collaborating with driven teams, I aim to create software that is reliable, efficient, and meaningful at scale.
